                <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
                <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls,
                    a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
                </p>

                <h3>How are they yurts finished?</h3> 
                <p>Each yurt is finished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes
                    electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers
                    of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
