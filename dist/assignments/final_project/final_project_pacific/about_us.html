                            <h3>Marcus</h3>
                            <p>Marcus is a proud graduate of the University of Southern California, where he majored in Political Science.
                                After graduating, Marcus considered following in his father's footsteps and becoming a lawyer, but he never had 
                                the same fire as his father to practice law. After some soul-searching, Marcus went on a camping trip with some friends,
                                and realized that his passion was in seeing other people come together around a camp fire, far away from any electronic distractions, 
                                and enjoying one another's company.

                            <h3>Sabrina</h3>
                            <p>Sabrina met Marcus while studying at USC, and the two became close friends rather instantly. Sabrina has a background in Computer Science, but her true passion 
                                is in interior decorating, where she single-handedly designed our award-winning luxury yurts all on her own!

                            <h3>Roger</h3>
                            <p>Roger is a childhood friend of Marcus, and his previous experience was in the military where he claims he learned all his keys to survival. We lean very heavily on Roger's experience with nature,
                                and you can rest assured that you are in trusted hands whenever you participate in our hiking excursions or kayak voyages.
