            My favorite drink would probably have to be a nice, cold glass of water. For a long time, I would've said Dr. Pepper is my favorite drink,
            but water is quite the wonderful drink for a number of reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>Ideal to drink on a hot day.</li>
                <li>Keeps you hyrdated</li>
                <li>Helps with bodily functions</li>
                <li>Boosts skin health</li>
                <li>Helps prevent kidney damage</li>
            </ul>
