            <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls,
                a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>How are they yurts finished?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Each yurt is finished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes
                electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers
                of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
